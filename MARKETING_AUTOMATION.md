## 📍 Pinterest: Your #1 Traffic Source

### Why Pinterest?

- ✅ People actively searching for products
- ✅ Pins last 3-6 months (vs. Instagram 24 hours)
- ✅ Free traffic forever
- ✅ Perfect for digital products

### Pinterest Setup (1 hour)

**Step 1: Create Business Account**
1. Go to pinterest.com/business/create
2. Choose "Build your brand"
3. Add profile photo (your logo or product image)
4. Write bio: "Digital [your niche] templates to simplify your life 🌿 | Instant download"
5. Add website (your Etsy shop URL)

Create 5-10 boards related to your niche:
- "[Your Niche] Templates"

4. **Lifestyle:** Show product in use
5. **Comparison:** "Before vs. After Using This Planner"
